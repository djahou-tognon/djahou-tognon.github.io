 I am Post-Doctoral researcher at __[Intitut Dénis Poisson](https://www.idpoisson.fr/)__, __[Université d'Orléans](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/)__. I develop a machine-learning model to predict stage (water level) and discharge at the junction of multiple channels."


Previously from April 2022 to june 2025, I was a Ph. D. candidate at INRIA Paris [ANGE team](https://team.inria.fr/ange/) and [Laboratoire Jacques Louis Lions (Sorbonne Université)](https://www.ljll.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Julien Salomon](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Julien.Salomon/).
<!-- I am currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at the __[Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (INRIA) Centre de Paris](https://inria.fr/fr)__, as part of the __[ANGE Project-Team](https://team.inria.fr/ange/)__ in collaboration with __[Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/)__ within the __[Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL)](https://www.ljll.fr/)__.-->

My research focuses on __High-Performance Computing (HPC)__, with a particular emphasis on the development of __parallel-in-time algorithms [(PinT)](https://parallel-in-time.org/)__ and the analysis of their convergence behavior for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained optimization problems. In addition to my work in HPC, I am exploring the intersection of scientific computing and machine learning, known as __Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)__. My goal is to leverage SciML techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of solving complex PDEs, contributing to advances in both computational mathematics and machine learning. <!--I am also interested in domain decomposition methods in general and computational fluid dynamics.-->

I am passionate about developing computational methods that push the boundaries of performance and scalability, with the broader goal of solving challenging real-world problems through mathematical modeling and simulation.
