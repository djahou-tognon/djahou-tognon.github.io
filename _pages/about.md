<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at the __[Institut National de Recherche en Sciences et Technologies du Numérique (INRIA) Centre de Paris](https://inria.fr/fr)__, as part of the __[ANGE Project-Team](https://team.inria.fr/ange/)__ in collaboration with __[Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/)__ within the __[Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (LJLL)](https://www.ljll.fr/)__. 

<!--My research focuses on __High-Performance Computing (HPC)__, with a particular emphasis on the development of __parallel-in-time algorithms (PinT)__ and the analysis of their convergence behavior for solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained optimization problems. In addition to my work in HPC, I am exploring the intersection of scientific computing and machine learning, known as __Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)__. My aim is to leverage SciML techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of solving complex PDEs, contributing to advances in both computational mathematics and machine learning.

I am passionate about developing computational methods that push the boundaries of performance and scalability, with the broader goal of solving challenging real-world problems through mathematical modeling and simulation.-->

I am also interested in domain decomposition methods in general and computational fluid dynamics.
